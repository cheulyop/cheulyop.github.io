I am a Data Manager at **[Upstage](https://www.upstage.ai/)**.
I work on:
* automating Data Management Operations (DMOps),
* and developing LLM-based applications.

Previously, I was:
*  an AI Researcher at [Silvia Health](https://silvia.io/). I trained models to detect cognitive impairments from speech.
* a Master's student in [Interactive Computing Lab](https://ic.kaist.ac.kr/) at KAIST. I worked on:
  * [AdaptiveESM](https://github.com/cheulyop/AdaptiveESM) -- an active learning approach towards a balanced and efficient collection of emotions in the wild.
  * [K-EmoCon Dataset](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3762961) -- a multimodal, biometric sensor dataset for recognizing emotions in the wild.

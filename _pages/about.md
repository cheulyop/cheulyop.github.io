I am currently working as an AI Researcher at **[Silvia Health](https://silvia.io)**.

At Silvia, we are building a technology that enables early screening of cognitive impairments from spontaneous speech, and [more](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.silvia).

I was a member of the [Interactive Computing Lab](http://ic.kaist.ac.kr/wiki/wiki.cgi?Main) at [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/). During my time there, I worked on the following projects:
* [AdaptiveESM](https://github.com/cheulyop/AdaptiveESM) - an adaptive sampling method based on active learning for collecting emotions in the wild.
* [PyTEAP](https://github.com/cheulyop/PyTEAP) - a Python implementation of the [TEAP](https://github.com/Gijom/TEAP) (Toolbox for Emotion Analysis using Physiological signals).
* [K-EmoCon Dataset](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3762961) for the [SuggestBot Project](https://suggestbot.github.io/) -- a multimodal sensor dataset for continuous emotion recognition in naturalistic conversations.

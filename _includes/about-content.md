I am a Software Engineer on the **[Upstage](https://www.upstage.ai/)** Data Team.

I'm interested in two questions:

1. How can we correctly incentivize data contributors so we can have more "good" data?
2. How can humans and AI work together to create better data?

Towards that, I am building a system that helps people better evaluate and guide LLMs.

I have also worked on applying RAG to build a chat engine for virtual idols, as well as a system for the automatic evaluation of insurance claims.

Before joining Upstage, I worked as an AI Researcher at [Silvia Health](https://silvia.io/), where I trained models to detect cognitive impairments from speech on smartphones.

Prior to that, I was a Master's student in the [Interactive Computing Lab](https://ic.kaist.ac.kr/) at KAIST. I worked on [AdaptiveESM](https://github.com/cheulyop/AdaptiveESM) — an active learning approach for balanced and efficient collection of emotions in the everyday setting — and the [K-EmoCon Dataset](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3762961), a multimodal biometric sensor dataset for recognizing emotions in the wild.
